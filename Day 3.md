## âœ… Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Square and Square Root

```sql
SELECT POWER(x, 2);      -- SquareSELECT SQRT(x);          -- Square Root
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ UNION and UNION ALL

- Combines results from two or more SELECTs.
- `UNION` removes duplicates.
- `UNION ALL` keeps all results.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNIONSELECT name FROM managers;

```

### 2. LEFT JOIN

LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN (simulated)

```sql
SELECT e.id, e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.idUNIONSELECT e.id, e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- `JOIN`s combine rows across tables based on relationships.
- `UNION` combines datasets vertically.
- Use `POWER()` and `SQRT()` for basic math operations.
- Column counts and types must match in `UNION` queries.
